✅ Fix: Reinitialize the MySQL Data Folder
This will reset your MySQL system tables, so do this only if you don’t have important databases, or make a backup first.

🔁 Step-by-step Fix
✅ Backup Your Current Data

Go to: C:\xampp\mysql\data

Copy the entire data folder and save it elsewhere (for backup).

🗑️ Delete the data Folder

Now go back to C:\xampp\mysql

Delete the data folder

📂 Copy Fresh data Folder

Go to: C:\xampp\mysql\backup

Copy the entire backup folder and rename it to data

Now you'll have a clean default mysql database structure.

🔧 Initialize MySQL

Open XAMPP as Administrator

Click Start on MySQL


✅ Option 1: Restore Database Folders (Best if You Didn't Lose .frm, .ibd, .ibdata1)
If you still have your old data folder backup, do this:

🔁 Step-by-Step to Restore Specific Databases:
Go to your backup folder
Example: C:\xampp\backup\data-backup

Copy only your project folders
These are folders named after your databases. For example:

nginx
Copy
Edit
my_project_db
student_mgmt
gym_system
❌ Don't copy:

mysql

performance_schema

information_schema

phpmyadmin

Paste into your current active data folder:
C:\xampp\mysql\data

✅ Set Permissions (if needed)

Make sure the copied folders have full read/write access.

You may need to stop MySQL, paste, then start MySQL again.

🔄 Restart MySQL via XAMPP

Go to XAMPP and stop/start MySQL.

🌐 Open phpMyAdmin

Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin

Your databases should now be visible and accessible.

✅ Steps:
🔻 Stop MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel (very important).

🗂️ Go to your backup folder (e.g., data-backup) and find only your project database folders, like:

Copy
Edit
gym_system/
student_mgmt/
school_attendance/
❌ Do not copy folders like:

Copy
Edit
mysql/
performance_schema/
phpmyadmin/
These are system folders and already present in your new clean setup.

📥 Paste those project folders only into:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
C:\xampp\mysql\data
🛠️ If using InnoDB (has .ibd files):

You may also need the ibdata1 file from the original backup.

If you copied only the folders but didn’t bring ibdata1, the .ibd files may not work (InnoDB stores metadata in ibdata1).

▶️ Start MySQL again from XAMPP.

🌐 Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin) and check if your databases show up.
